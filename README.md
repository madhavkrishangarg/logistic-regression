This repository contains a Python solution for a logistic regression task predicting income categories in the Adult dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Using LBFGS backend, missing values were labeled as UNKNOWN. Achieving an overall accuracy of 0.82 (train: 0.82, test: 0.83), the code implements cross-validation (70-15-15 split) with a mean accuracy of 0.82 and standard deviation of 0.0048 over 15-20 randomized sets.
